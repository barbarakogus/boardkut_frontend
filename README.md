# Boardkut

My family and I have always enjoyed playing boardgames. And the move to Sweden, linked to the covid situation, made boardgames my leisure in my spare time.

So, since I have a quite of games, why not create an app to manipulate this data? That is the idea of the Boardkut. An app where I can add, delete and update information about my boardgames. 

The layout of this project was inspired by Orkut social media.

To build this app I am using react, redux, and Postgres to store the data.
